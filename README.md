# Early-Detection-of-CoVid-19-using-Chest-X-Ray-Scans
This project entails an image classification model (created via Transfer Learning using PyTorch and ResNet-18 pretrained model) that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes (Normal, Viral Pneumonia, Covid-19) with a reasonably high accuracy. Secondary objective is to make a simple web app using StreamLit for uploading the image and classifying it.
